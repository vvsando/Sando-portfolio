# Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
### This chart depicts the number of HIV diagnoses by mode of transmission, pulled from a 2019 report of Pennsylvania's State of Health Equity. I created an excel file with data from the chart, which is also shown below.

# Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization

# Step 3: Wireframe a Solution
### Below is a sketch of my revised daa visualization design for the chart in step 1. I decided to use a line chart to better illustrate the the cases as they progress by year, and I used different colors to distinguish the mode of transmission. I added the data label to increase clarity for the viewer.

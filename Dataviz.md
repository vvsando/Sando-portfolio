# Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
### This chart depicts the number of HIV diagnoses by mode of transmission, pulled from a 2019 report of Pennsylvania's State of Health Equity. I created an excel file with data from the chart, which is also shown below.

# Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization

# Step 3: Wireframe a Solution
### Below is a sketch of my revised data visualization design for the chart in step 1. I decided to use a line chart to better illustrate trends within the cases as they progress by year, and I used different colors to distinguish the modes of transmission. I added the data label to increase clarity for the viewer.

# Step 4: Test the Solution
### FEEDBACK #1
### Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a number new diagnoses from 2012 to 2012, looking at different population groups. Its looking at the trend of new cases of HIV diagnoses each year by population group.
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It's comparing the population groups, and it is sowing an increase or decrease in a trend
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Undetermined is interesting. Why was there a drastic decrease then increase? What played a part in that? Could that section be broken down?
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
This is intended for people who are working in the HIV epidemic field: health care providers, grant-writers, clinic-owners, etc.
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Define what the "Pediatric" and "Undetermined/Other" modes.
 
### FEEDBACK #2
### Can you tell me what you think this is?
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?

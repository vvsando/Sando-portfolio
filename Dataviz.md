# Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
### This chart depicts the number of HIV diagnoses by mode of transmission, pulled from a 2019 report of Pennsylvania's State of Health Equity. I chose this chart because it shows meaningful data is an unmeaningful way, and I wanted to play with the data visualization techniques we have learned to see how I can recreate this in a way that can attract the intended audience. One of my closest friends is an H.I.V patient educator and does a lot of research concerning H.I.V, so i figured I can use her as a reference to determine if my recreation caters to whom the intended audience might be. Below is a screenshot of the data visualization, along with a link to access the file. The chart can be found on page 17.

### I created an excel spreadsheet with the data points to use in Flouorish. Here is a screenshot:

# Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization
### Below is a screensot of my critique of the data visualization displayed above.

# Step 3: Wireframe a Solution
### Below is a sketch of my revised data visualization design for the chart in step 1. I decided to use a line chart to better illustrate trends within the cases as they progress by year, and I used different colors to distinguish the modes of transmission. I added the data label to increase clarity for the viewer.

# Step 4: Test the Solution
### FEEDBACK #1
### Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a number new diagnoses from 2012 to 2012, looking at different population groups. Its looking at the trend of new cases of HIV diagnoses each year by population group.
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It's comparing the population groups, and it is showing an increase or decrease in a trend
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Undetermined is interesting. Why was there a drastic decrease then increase? What played a part in that? Could that section be broken down?
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
This is intended for people who are working in the HIV epidemic field: health care providers, grant-writers, clinic-owners, etc.
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Define what the "Pediatric" and "Undetermined/Other" modes.
 
### FEEDBACK #2
### Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a graph concerning H.I.V.
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It is telling me about different social groups that are contracting H.I.V over a periiod of time.
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Undetermined is confusing. What does that mean?
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The intended audience might be people in the LGBTQ+ community, and people who are sexually active in general
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would specify what "undetermined means".

# Step 5: Build your Solution

### My final data visualization is an interactive line chart that illustrates the evolution in the number of cases over the 5 years of data collected. Anticipating the intended audience to be medical professionals, reasearchers, and policy influencers who may use this data as a means to determine focal areas to mitigate the spread of H.I.V, I wanted to create a chart that allows the viewer to visualize this evolution. The interactive line charts takes the viewer through the change in number of cases while comparing these changes relatively to other modes. Seeing that this chart is part of a 48-page report with lots of pertinent information, it is imperative for viewers to rapidly gather meaningful information from the data visualizations. Unlike the bar chart, the interactive aspect of line chart helps readers determine trends and patterns within seconds of analyzing it. Both people I conversed with were able to determine that the chart is meant to depict trends in cases of H.I.V diagnosis for different modes   the "undetermined" mode of transmission was confusion; while I could not change the data, I added some text

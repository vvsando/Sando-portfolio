# OUTLINE
### Summary
For my final project, I would like to depict the effect of urban freeways on black communities across the country. My goal is to highlight the racist nature of the highway system by depicting the correlation between freeway counstruction and the destruction of colored commnities.
### Project Structure
From my presentation, I hope my peers are galvanized to learn more about the intent of transportation infrastructure either in their respective home towns or within Pittsburgh. To do this, I plan on structuring my presentation in the following manner:


1st Data Viz
- A map of the United States, depicting prominent black communities in the early 1900s and the locations where freeways were constructed. My hope is for the viewers to see how black communities were targeted when these highways were constructed.

2nd Data Viz
- A chart depicting the number of habitants before State Route 65 and after in the Manchester-Chateau area.
- Pictures illustrating the effects of State Route 65 on Manchester-Chateau. 

3rd Data Viz
- Visualization depicting the difference in the economic state of communities affected by highways construction. A contrast between both sides.

Call to Action
- An invitation to attend TransportationCamp, an event taking place this November to highlight the issues within transportation in the city of Pittsburgh.

# INITIAL SKETCHES
Below is a sketch of the first visualization I have in mind, which depicts the correlation between black neighborhoods and freeway construction sites.

This article illustrates maps and pictures of freeways being build across black neighborhoods. I plan on using these visualizations to recreate a map that shows the locations of the neighborhoods and construction sites.

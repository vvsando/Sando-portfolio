# Part 3: The Final Data Story
### The Beginning
When I commenced my final project, I wanted to tell a story about how transportation infrastructure has disadvantaged marginalized population, specifically within Pittsburgh. As a Policy Intern for an organization that works to amelioriate transportation infrastructure in Southwestern Pennsylvania, I planned on utilizing my final project as a deliverable for the organization. Since my presenation is about transportation infrastructure and the injustices within, I had many ideas about utilizing maps to visualize displacement, bus route inequity, highway effect on homeownership by demographic, etc. My lack of experience with GIS or any other mapping software posed a problem as I began thinking about how to visualize the data and navigating through Part I, so I knew I would need to determine other ways to tell this story profoundly.

# Part 3: The Final Data Story
### The Beginning
When I commenced my final project, I wanted to tell a story about how urban freeways have disadvantaged marginalized population, specifically within Pittsburgh. As a Policy Intern for an organization that works to amelioriate transportation infrastructure in Southwestern Pennsylvania, I planned on utilizing my final project as a deliverable for the organization. Since my presenation is about transportation infrastructure and the injustices within, I had many ideas about utilizing maps to visualize displacement, bus route inequity, highway effect on homeownership by demographic, etc. My lack of experience with GIS or any other mapping software posed a problem as I began thinking about how to visualize the data and navigating through Part I, so I knew I would need to determine other ways to tell this story profoundly.

### The Transition
As I began putting the wireframes together for my final project, I found it difficult to visualize all the data I would have liked to visualize through maps, as anticiapted. I decided to use maps only to visualize the correlation between areas that were inhabited by predominantly Black people and areas that were chosen for freeway construction. I determined that since my focus was on the construction of urban freeways, I can use pictures to illustrate the main points I would like to make. I put together pictures of redlining, before and after pictures of freeway construction projects, and the maps I created to show the correlation aforementioned. When I conducted my user research, I realized that the effect I wanted in the begininning was lost. The partipiants needed the excerpts to make sense of the wireframes, which meant that I needed to work on my flow. Overall, I all participants knew what the main idea of the presentation was. However, some parts of the data were not clear, expecailly the maps I created. 

### The Final Edits
After having further conversations with my peers, my manager, and my professor, I decided that broadening the scope of my topic will be beneficial in telling a more compelling story. I shifted from focusing on urban freeways to urban development, which encompasses everything related to freeway construction and transportation infrastructure. I also broadened the scope from Pittsburgh to the United States, which enabled me to find data more data sources. Since I could not use screenshopt of aerial maps, I used infogram to make comparisons of the conditions betfore and after freeway construction. I used Shorthand to tell my story, and my audience is my classmates who will be watching the presentation. I am using this opportunity to encourage my peers to attend Transportation Camp PGH, and event that will give attendees the opportunity to learn, discuss, and brainstorm ideas around the amelioration of transportation infrastructure in the city. I designed my presentation to be in an informative.persuasive way. One of the main things i implemented in my presentation is asking the question "what are YOU going to do?", with the 'you' in bold and red.

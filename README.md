# About Me
I am a 2nd-year MSPPM candidate at the Heinz college. I am originally from Cameroon, and I migrated to the United States with my family when I was 10 years old. Before Heinz, I spent some time in the classroom as an educator.
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to effectively convey data heavy information to a crowd of people who unnderstand things at different levels/capacities.
# Portfolio

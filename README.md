# About Me
Hello, my name is Velie Sando, and my gender pronouns and she/her. I am a 2nd-year MSPPM candidate at the Heinz college, and I moved to Pittsburgh from San Antonio, Tx. last year. I migrated from Cameroon to the United States with my family when I was 10 years old. Before Heinz, I spent some time in the classroom as an educator where I taught middle school English Language Arts. In my free time, I enjoy dancing and I also taught Modern African dance style in the San Antonio community.
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to effectively convey data heavy information to a crowd of people who unnderstand things at different levels/capacities. Once I graduate, I hope to move to D.C to work in a capacity where I analyze data in a meaningful way to make policy recommendations.

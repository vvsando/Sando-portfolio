# About Me
Hello, my name is Velie Sando, and my gender pronouns are she/her. I am a 2nd-year MSPPM candidate at the Heinz college, and I moved to Pittsburgh from San Antonio, Tx. last year. I migrated from Cameroon to the United States with my family when I was 10 years old, and I lived in Maryland for 3 years before moving to Texas. Before Heinz, I spent some time in the classroom as an educator where I taught middle school English Language Arts. In my free time, I enjoy dancing and I also taught Modern African dance style in the San Antonio community.
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how to effectively convey data-heavy information to a crowd of people who unnderstand things at different levels/capacities. Once I graduate, I hope to move to D.C to work in a capacity where I analyze data in a meaningful way to make policy recommendations.

## The line charts above display the Debt-to-GDP ratios of different countries, with the last chart focusing on a comparison between the United Kingdom and the United States. For the first visualization, the grid of charts is utilized to display the debt-to-gdp ratio of 35 different countries. Each line chart has an identitical structure (same color, country acronym displayeed in the same location, same amount of numbers on x and y axes, etc), which makes is easy for the reader to follow general trends within the data presented. For the second visualization, 
## The first method of visualization is effective when looking to get a general sense of trends withing the ratio for multiple. Contrarily, the secong chart is more appropriate when looking to analyze trends within one specific country. The grid of line charts may be oerwhelming since there are 35 different charts to view, but this can be a useful way of presenting data for countries in the same continent or region. I chose the third visualization because I wanted to depict the debt-to-gdp ratio for one specific country to show why different line charts would be appropriate.

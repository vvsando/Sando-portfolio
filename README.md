# Welcome to Velie's World
Hello, my name is Velie Sando, and my gender pronouns are she/her. I am a 2nd-year MSPPM candidate at the Heinz college, and I moved to Pittsburgh from San Antonio, Tx. last year. I migrated from Cameroon to the United States with my family when I was 10 years old, and I lived in Maryland for 3 years before moving to Texas. Before Heinz, I spent some time in the classroom as an educator where I taught middle school English Language Arts. In my free time, I enjoy dancing and I also taught Modern African dance style in the San Antonio community.
# Telling Stories with Data: What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn more about how to effectively convey data-heavy information to a crowd of people who unnderstand things at different levels/capacities. Once I graduate, I hope to move to D.C to work in a capacity where I analyze data in a meaningful way to make policy recommendations.

### The line charts above display the Debt-to-GDP ratios of different countries, with the last chart focusing on a comparison between the United Kingdom and the United States. For the first visualization, the grid of charts is utilized to display the debt-to-gdp ratio of 35 different countries. Each line chart has an identitical structure (same color scheme, country acronym displayeed in the same location, same amount of numbers on x and y axes, etc), which makes is easy for the reader to follow. For the second visualization, a single line chart is utilized to make a comparison between the UK and USA. The color scheme used for this chart allows each line to stand out, making it easy for the reader to follow each country's ratio individually and collectively. 
### The first method of visualization is effective when analyzing general trends withing the ratio for multiple countries. This can be appropriate specificallt when analyzing the ratio of countries within the same continent, proximity, etc. Contrarily, the second chart is more appropriate when looking to analyze specific trends within  a small number of countries. The grid of line charts may be oerwhelming since there are 35 different charts to view, but the single line chart can be a useful way of presenting data to compare, contrast, and/or closely analyze similar trends or stark differences for a small number of countries. I chose the third visualization because I wanted to depict how simple yet effective a line chart can be when looking to make a comparison. I recreated the data to show solely UK and US' ratios in excel to achieve this. Every aspect of the chart is meant to depict a clear comparison; I utilized vs. in the title, and I used the flourish 1 color scheme since the blue and yellow stand out individually. Additionally, I titles the axes to clarify what metrics they represent, and I intentionally did not add the data laels on each point since hovering over it gives you the data.
